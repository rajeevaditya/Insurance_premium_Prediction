# Insurance_premium_Prediction

Problem Statement
Dataset: Insurance premium data
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/simranjain17/insurance

Import Libraries/Dataset
1. Download the dataset
2. Import the required libraries
Data Visualization and Exploration 
1. Print 2 rows for sanity check to identify all the features present in the dataset and
if the target matches with them.
2. Comment on class imbalance with appropriate visualization method.
3. Provide appropriate visualizations to get an insight about the dataset.
4. Do the correlational analysis on the dataset. Provide a visualization for the same.
Will this correlational analysis affect the feature selection that you will perform in
the next step? Justify your answer. Answers must have justification to be
awarded marks.
5. Any other visualisation specific to the problem statement.
2. Data Pre-processing and cleaning 
1. Do the appropriate pre-processing of the data like identifying NULL or Missing
Values if any, handling of outliers if present in the dataset, skewed data etc.
Mention the pre-processing steps performed in the markdown cell. Explore a few
latest data balancing tasks and its effect on model evaluation parameters.
2. Apply appropriate feature engineering techniques for them. Apply the feature
transformation techniques like Standardization, Normalization, etc. You are free to
apply the appropriate transformations depending upon your datasetâ€™s structure
and complexity. Provide proper justification. Techniques used without
justification will not be awarded marks. Explore a few techniques for identifying
feature importance for your feature engineering task.
3. Model Building 
1. Split the dataset into training and test sets. Answers without justification will
not be awarded marks. [1 M]
Case 1 : Train = 80 % Test = 20% [ x_train1,y_train1] = 80% ;
[ x_test1,y_test1] = 20% ;
Case 2 : Train = 10 % Test = 90% [ x_train2,y_train2] = 10% ;
[ x_test2,y_test2] = 90%
2. Explore k-fold cross-validation.
3. Build Model/s using 1) Linear Regression 
1. Do the prediction for the test data and display the results for the inference.
Calculate all the evaluation metrics and choose the best for your model. Justify
your answer. Answers must have justification to be awarded marks. 
2. List out the performance measures in a tabular format. (Accuracy, F1-score,
Efficiency, sensitivity or specificity)
